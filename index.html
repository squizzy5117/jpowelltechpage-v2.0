                    <p>I Am Passionate About Code & Web Design !.   
                        I have had many years of experience in retail industries, including Hotels, 
                        catering and customer relations with excellence results, as an 
                        employee and employer with year’s of practical knowledge in management. 
                        Now having discovered time to engage in web development which I love, 
                        I'm eager to share my skills and genuine creative ideas in the world of Tech. 
                        I am ambitious and keen to develop a good relationship with clients that 
                        I am presented with. I take a responsible approach to any task or situation that 
                        I undertake as if it's my own project. I am very capable of working by myself, 
                        or with others to achieve customers objectives with excellence results. 
                        Thanks for taking the time to read about me , Jim.

                            <p>What do you want users to do once they’ve found your website? 
                            Do you want them to buy your product, contact you, or subscribe to your 
                            business e-newsletter? You need to tell visitors what the next step is 
                            and when (ideally, now!). Your content should answer the question,
                            “What’s in it for me?” and then the call to action tells them what to do next..</p>
